# GeneticAlgorithms

My first python project. 
Uses inheritance, selection and random mutation to guess a string inputted to the console by the user. 
Look in genetic.py to see parameters such as target string, number of parents per generation, 
number of children, mutation rate.

This was written on a climbing trip in Spain with very limited internet. 
The lack of online resources led me to write my own bubble sort algorithm to think through problems.
I intend to re-visit the project and clean up the variable names.
